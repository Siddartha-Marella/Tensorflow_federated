# Tensorflow_federated
Trying out different features of tensorflow federated learning


Started this project after following the tensorflow installation.
It failed in windows with multiple errors and also on Colab with package incompatible issues

Following the installation instructions at "https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/install", I was able
to install on a ubuntu 20.4 machine.

As a first learning task, I am following the image classification task at
"https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification"
